# Tracify
A Task Tracking Application for Accountability, Verifiability and Traceability.

## Summary
Tracify is designed to ensure verifiability and traceability of tasks. With a focus on accountability and trust, Tracify offers the following key functionalities:

Immutable Task Recording: Once tasks are recorded, the data becomes immutable, providing a reliable audit trail. This feature ensures the integrity of task records, enhancing transparency and trust.

Transparent Task Tracking: Users can monitor task progress and completion status in real-time. With transparent tracking, stakeholders can stay informed and accountable throughout the task lifecycle.

Additionally, we will add privacy and security measures to protect sensitive task data and user information. Encryption, access controls, and anonymity features are implemented to safeguard confidentiality, ensuring user trust and confidence in the platform.

Through these functionalities, Tracify empowers users to effectively manage tasks while maintaining verifiability, traceability, and security.

## Feature backlog
Here is a list of key functionalities we are planning to provide:

#1 Immutable tasks: once recorded, the data cannot be altered, providing a reliable audit trail.

#2 Enforcing tasks: implement automation (predefined rules and conditions) ensuring that tasks are completed as agreed upon.

#3 Transparent Tracking: enable task progress and completion status. Users should be able to view real-time updates (for accountability and trust.)

#4 Timestamping: add timestamping mechanisms to record the exact time when tasks are initiated, completed, or modified. This one is a must have and super easy to implement as it only needs a UUID to be provided at each CRUD operation (not a big deal).

#5 Immutable Documentation: let users to attach relevant documentation or evidence to support task completion. Immutable storage ensures that documentation cannot be tampered with or manipulated.

#6 Permission Management: implement robust permission management controls to regulate access to task data and actions. Different users may have varying levels of authority or visibility within the system.

#7 Privacy and Security: Prioritize privacy and security measures to safeguard sensitive task data and user information. Encryption, access controls, and anonymity features may be necessary to protect confidentiality.

#8 Verification Mechanisms: add  verification mechanisms to validate task completion criteria, like digital signatures, multi-factor authentication, or consensus-based validation from network participants.

#9 Incentive Mechanisms: add  incentive mechanisms (e.g., rewards, tokens) to encourage active participation and honest reporting of task completion.
